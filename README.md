# Project Name: Chatbot Showcase - Different AI Smartness Levels

## Description
This project demonstrates the development of a website showcasing various chatbots with different AI smartness levels. The website provides live examples of chatbots ranging from basic rule-based bots to more sophisticated bots using natural language processing (NLP) and AI platforms.

## Features
- **Basic Chatbot**: A simple rule-based chatbot with predefined responses.
- **Intermediate Chatbot**: An NLP-powered chatbot using libraries like NLTK or SpaCy.
- **Advanced Chatbot**: Integration with AI platforms like Dialogflow, Wit.ai, or Rasa.

Each chatbot section includes a live demonstration, code examples, and a brief explanation of how the chatbot works. The website aims to provide an interactive and educational experience to learn about chatbot development and AI capabilities.

## Contributions
Contributions and enhancements to showcase additional chatbot examples or improve existing ones are welcome. Please follow the guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository.
- Open `index.html` in your web browser to access the website and interact with the chatbots.
- Explore the code and documentation in the repository for more details on each chatbot's implementation.

## Planning and Design:

- Define the purpose and goals of the website.
- Plan the layout and design of the website, including how different chatbots will be showcased.

## Set Up the Website:

- Purchase a domain name and hosting plan if you don't have one already.
- Install a web server, such as Apache or Nginx, to host your website.
- Choose a programming language and framework for building the website. For this example, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Create Website Pages:

- Design the homepage with an overview of chatbots and their smartness levels.
- Create separate pages for each chatbot to provide more details and demonstrations.

## Implement Chatbots:

- Choose different chatbot libraries or APIs with varying levels of AI capabilities. For example:
  - Basic Chatbot: Use rule-based chatbots with predefined responses.
  - Intermediate Chatbot: Use natural language processing (NLP) libraries like NLTK or SpaCy.
  - Advanced Chatbot: Integrate with AI platforms like Dialogflow, Wit.ai, or Rasa.

## Integration and Code Examples:

- Showcase code snippets or examples for each chatbot, explaining how they work.
- Provide live demonstrations of each chatbot on their respective pages.

## User Interaction:

- Implement user interfaces to interact with each chatbot. You can use text input fields for users to enter messages and see responses.

## Testing and Debugging:

- Thoroughly test the website and all chatbot interactions to ensure they work as expected.
- Debug any issues that may arise during testing.

## Deployment:

- Deploy the website on your web server, making it accessible to the public.

## Documentation:

- Create clear and concise documentation explaining the purpose, usage, and smartness levels of each chatbot.

## Final Review:

- Review the website to ensure everything is functioning correctly and looks presentable.
